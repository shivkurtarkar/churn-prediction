# Predicting Customer Churn for Music streaming service

## Problem Description

This project aims to predict customer churn for subscription based music streaming service.

Churn, in this context, refers to customers not renewing or canceling his sbscription. This is a critical problem for streaming platforms as customer retention is often more cost-effective than acquiring new customers.

By accurately predicting churn, streaming service can proactively implement retention strategies, such as targeted offers, improved customer service, or personalized song recomendation. This can lead to increased customer lifetime value and reduced revenue loss.

## Setup & Instructions to Get Data

The following steps outline how to set up the environment and access the data:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [invalid URL removed]
    cd banking-churn-prediction
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Data Acquisition:**

    *   If using a publicly available dataset, download it and place it in the `data/` directory. The specific download instructions will be in `notebook.ipynb`.
    *   If using synthetic data, the `notebook.ipynb` will contain the code to generate it and save it to the `data/` directory.

## Project Structure

*   `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the project.
*   `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preparation, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
*   `train.py`: Python script for training the final model.
*   `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for containerizing the application.
*   `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Model Usage

Instructions on how to run the model for predictions will be provided in the `README.md` within the "Productionizing" and "Deployment" sections.

## Deliverables

*   `README.md`: This file.
*   `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preparation, EDA, and model development.
*   `train.py`: Python script for training the final model.
*   `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for deployment.
*   `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Further Development

Future work could include:

*   Exploring more advanced machine learning models.
*   Implementing real-time churn prediction.
*   Integrating the model into a production environment.
*   Deploying the service to the cloud.
