# Project Evaluation  
```
## Problem Description  
- [x] Problem is described in README with enough context, so it's clear what the problem is and how the solution will be used  

## EDA  
- [x] Extensive EDA (ranges of values, missing values, analysis of target variable, feature importance analysis)  

## Model Training  
- [x] Trained multiple models and tuned their parameters. For neural networks: same as previous, but also with tuning: adjusting learning rate, dropout rate, size of the inner layer, etc.  

## Exporting Notebook to Script  
- [x] The logic for training the model is exported to a separate script  

## Reproducibility  
- [x] It's possible to re-execute the notebook and the training script without errors. The dataset is committed in the project repository or there are clear instructions on how to download the data  

## Model Deployment  
- [x] Model is deployed (with Flask, BentoML or a similar framework)  

## Dependency and Environment Management
- [x] Provided a file with dependencies and used virtual environment. README says how to install the dependencies and how to activate the env  

## Containerization  
- [x] The application is containerized and the README describes how to build a container and how to run it  

## Cloud Deployment  
- [x] Docs describe clearly (with code) how to deploy the service to cloud or Kubernetes cluster (local or remote)  
- [x] There's code for deployment to cloud or Kubernetes cluster (local or remote). There's a URL for testing - or video/screenshot of testing it
